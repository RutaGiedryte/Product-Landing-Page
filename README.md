# Product-Landing-Page
A simple responsive product landing page, made by following a tutorial

Another small project, which I used as an opportunity to learn about grid, flex, media queries and in general broaden my skills little by little. 
I followed a tutorial by Traversy Media on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61R5kn_kYwY), however, I changed the theme and some details in the code for ir to fit my liking.
