# Product-Landing-Page
A simple responsive product landing page, made by following a tutorial

Another small project, which I used to learn about grid, flex, media queries, and generally broaden my skills. 
I followed a tutorial by Traversy Media on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61R5kn_kYwY). 
However, I changed the theme and some details in the code for it to fit my liking. This site is also deployed to Netlify (https://youphone-smartphones.netlify.app/).
